# Encryption-Program
This is a quick program you can use to safely encrypt messages with a repeating key. 

To use this program, create a project file in Java called "LearningJava" next import the code and run it. 

When running the code follow the steps below: 
Enter whether you want to "encrpyt" or "decrypt" a message. 
After this enter an integer number of your choice for encrpytion, or enter the appropriate encryption key for decryption. 
For encryption, each character in the phrase or string you have entered will be shifted by each integer in the key and this will repeat for the length of the string
For decryption, each character in the phrase or string you have entered will be de-shifted by each integer in the key and this will repeat for the length of the string

Congratulations! You have your own securely key-encrypted password or phrase which can only be decrypted with the appropriate key!
